The Object Oriented Design pattern I implemented is the Singleton class structure which is shown in the ATZFinance.java file. 
I added a method for making sure you can only create and retrieve one instance of this class, so that it follows the parameters for being a Singleton.

The UI Design pattern I implemented was Input Feedback on the login screen. When you launch the application use

Username = "username"
Password = "password"

to sign in. You'll see that if you type the incorrect information it will give you feedback about which was incorrect. If you login successfully, it tells you that you logged in successfully.

However, in our actual prototype, a successful login will just take the user to the home page.

Now added use case to approve loans and apply for your own loan. Go to customer login to approve loans. We added 3 test loans for adding the functionality, however you can add your own loan applications under the
user login.
